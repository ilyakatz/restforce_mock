# RestforceMock

Mock out [Restforce](https://github.com/ejholmes/restforce) in tests

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do

  gem 'restforce_mock'

end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install restforce_mock

## Usage

To mock out Restforce global in your test environment

```ruby
Restforce::Client = RestforceMock::Client
```

This will direct all calls to `Restforce` to `RestforceMock`. Test as usual.

### Configuration

```ruby
RestforceMock.configure do |config|
  config.schema_file = "spec/fixtures/schema.yml"
  config.error_on_required = true  # raise error if required field is not set
  config.required_exclusions = [:LastModifiedById ...] # fields that should not be considered required
end
```

### Mimicking Salesforce data

To mimic Salesforce database, add some data to the `RestfoceMock` sandbox

```ruby
  RestforceMock::Sandbox.add_object("Contact", "HGUKK674J79HjsH", { Name__c: "John" })
```

To access the object in the RestforceMock object

```ruby
  RestforceMock::Sandbox.get_object("Contact", "HGUKK674J79HjsH")
```

RestforceMock sandbox is **shared across all your tests** (same way as real Salesforce instace would be), hence,
after completion of tests make sure to clean up if necessary

```ruby
  RestforceMock::Sandbox.reset!
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
